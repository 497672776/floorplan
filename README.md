- **Introduction**

This project uses B*-Tree, SP (sequence pair), binary partition tree combined with simulated annealing for layout.

Provide two running entrances: main.cpp, test.cpp.

The default entry is main.cpp.

These two modes can be switched in CMakeLists.txt.

But test.cpp is not yet complete.
